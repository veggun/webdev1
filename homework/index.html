						<p class="mainText">Cillian Murphy (/ˈkɪliən/; born 25 May 1976) is an Irish actor and musician. He began his career performing as a rock musician. After turning down a record deal, he began his acting career in theater, and in short and independent films in the late 1990s. His first notable roles were in films such as 28 Days Later (2002), Cold Mountain (2003), Intermission (2003), Red Eye (2005) and Breakfast on Pluto (2005), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and won an Irish Film and Television Award for Best Actor. Murphy played the character of Jonathan Crane / Scarecrow in the Batman films of The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005–2012). In the mid-late 2000s, he starred in films such as The Wind That Shakes the Barley (2006), Sunshine (2007), The Edge of Love (2008), Inception (2010), and Peacock (2010).<br><br>

						Since 2013, Murphy has portrayed Thomas Shelby, the lead of the BBC gangster series Peaky Blinders, for which he has won two Irish Film and Television Awards for Best Actor – Drama, in 2017 and 2018 respectively. More recently, he has appeared in the films Transcendence (2014), In the Heart of the Sea (2015), Anthropoid (2016), Dunkirk (2017), Delinquent Season (2018), and Anna (2019). In 2020, he has a role in the sequel A Quiet Place Part II.</p>

						<p class="mainText">In mid-2004, Murphy married his long-time girlfriend, Yvonne McGuinness, whom he had met in 1996 at one of his rock band's shows. The couple live in Dublin (where they moved back in 2015 after previously living for 14 years in London) and have two sons, Malachy, born in December 2005, and Aran, born in July 2007<br><br>
						Music is still an important part of Murphy's life. In 2004, he said, "The only extravagant thing about my lifestyle is my stereo system, buying music and going to gigs." He no longer plays in a rock band, but regularly plays music with friends and on his own, and still writes songs. Murphy does not plan to start another band, and said, "Even if I was good, the very notion of being an actor with a rock band on the side would mean I'd never be taken seriously."
						He was a vegetarian for many years, not due to any moral objection to the killing of animals, but because of qualms about unhealthy agribusiness practices. He began eating meat again for his role in Peaky Blinders. He is a dedicated runner.<br><br>

						He often works in or near the city, and has expressed no desire to move to Hollywood. He prefers not to speak about his personal life, and did not appear on any live TV chat shows until 2010, when he was a guest on The Late Late Show on Ireland's RTÉ to promote Perrier's Bounty, yet still remained reserved. He does not have a stylist or a personal publicist, travels without an entourage, and often attends premieres alone. Reserved and private, Murphy professes a lack of interest in the celebrity scene, finding the red carpet experience "a challenge... and not one I want to overcome". He intentionally practises a lifestyle that will not interest the tabloids: "I haven't created any controversy, I don't sleep around, I don't go and fall down drunk".In 2005, Murphy stated he was friends with fellow Irish actors Colin Farrell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Liam Neeson, looking up to the latter like a "surrogate movie dad". But primarily, Murphy's close friendships are those he made before becoming a star.
						In 2015, he was named one of GQ's 50 best dressed men.</p>
